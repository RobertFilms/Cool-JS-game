# Cool JS game
 I was pondering on a line of code and saw it was in JS. This is my first JS game.
You might be wondering, "What does this 15 year old know about Programing?" well to be fair...
Not alot.
Many times I don't know what I code but I am working on that. I am getting better and working on this skill.
Main thing is I am not wasting my life going to parties wasting money. I am starting a bussnes and going to be a programer.
